        <h2>Design Stuff</h2>
        <p>
          Janet has several years of experience in fashion operations and design. She recently designed a 24-piece collection for the sock brand <a href='https://mingaberlin.com/en/'>MINGA BERLIN</a>, and has done graphic design and front-end web development for MINGA and <a href='https://www.westwardleaning.com'>Westward Leaning</a>. Her usual toolkit includes Photoshop and Illustrator for print and web mockups and HTML and CSS when the project calls for code. Her style emphasizes clean, sleek designs that are easy to navigate.
        </p>
        <p>
          When she isn't working on client projects, she is developing her own fashion line. A jack of all trades, Janet will take on any new project eager to learn and make the best product out there, whether physical or online. Just don't get caught between her and a clearance sale.
